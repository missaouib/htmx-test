# htmx-test

This project serves a web page using Thymeleaf for templating and server side rendering, and htmx for client side
interactivity.

The client code is bundled with vite to take advantage of npm packages and Typescript to add fine-grained interactivity.

## Start

First build the web project.

```bash
cd web
npm i
npm run watch
```

Then start the Spring Boot project.
